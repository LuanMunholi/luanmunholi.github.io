How the player will be able to create and delete black holes
How the game will keep track of points and determine when the player has won or lost
How the game will respond to user input, such as mouse clicks
How the game will update the positions of different game elements on the screen
A scoring system: You could use JavaScript to keep track of the player's score and display it on the page.
Power-ups: You could add power-ups to the game that give the player temporary abilities, such as the ability to create multiple black holes at once or to make the ball move faster.
Sound effects: You could use the HTML5 audio element to add sound effects to the game, such as a sound that plays when the ball bounces off a wall or a sound that plays when the player destroys an object.
Visual effects: You could use CSS3 transitions and animations to add visual effects to the game, such as a glowing effect when the player creates a black hole or a particle effect when the player destroys an object.
Multiple levels: You could create multiple levels for the player to progress through, with each level becoming progressively more difficult.
A leaderboard: You could create a leaderboard that tracks the top scores of all players and allows players to compare their scores to others.
A pause button: You could add a pause button that allows the player to pause the game and resume it later.
